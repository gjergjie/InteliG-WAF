# WAF Development Manifest

## Overview

This document serves as the detailed product manifest for the development of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) software. The WAF is designed to be an extended module for Apache2, HAProxy, and Nginx web servers, while also capable of running as a standalone application. The core functionalities include filtering HTTP requests based on OWASP rules, enhancing these rules with additional custom logic and AI/LLM (Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Models) capabilities, and monitoring TCP streams to detect ransomware executables. Additionally, a web-based interface (UI) will be developed for configuring the WAF settings, including LLM parameters.

## 1. Technology Stack

### 1.1 Programming Language
- **Primary Language**: Rust
- **Integration Mechanism**: C API for integration with Apache2, HAProxy, and Nginx.

### 1.2 Data Storage
- **In-memory Storage**: Local HashMap or equivalent fast data structure for rule enrichment.
- **Persistent Storage**: Optional integration with databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for persistent configuration and logs.

### 1.3 Web Interface
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React or Angular framework).
- **Backend**: Rust (with a framework like Actix-web or Rocket for handling HTTP requests).
- **API**: RESTful API for communication between the web interface and the WAF backend.

### 1.4 AI/LLM Integration
- **Machine Learning Models**: Initial integration with pre-trained models, with the option to update and refine these models.
- **Configuration**: Parameters for AI/LLM will be configurable via the web interface.

## 2. Core Functional Requirements

### 2.1 WAF as a Web Server Module

#### 2.1.1 Integration with Web Servers
- **C API**: Implement a C API layer to allow Rust-based WAF integration with Apache2, HAProxy, and Nginx.
- **HTTP Stream Hook**: The WAF will hook into the HTTP stream of these servers, inspecting all incoming and outgoing HTTP requests and responses.

#### 2.1.2 OWASP Rules Implementation
- **Rule Set**: Integrate the latest OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) into the WAF.
- **Request Filtering**: The WAF will inspect HTTP requests against the OWASP rules and block or log any malicious requests.

#### 2.1.3 Rule Enrichment
- **In-memory Storage**: Implement an in-memory HashMap for storing enriched rules that extend or modify the base OWASP rules.
- **Dynamic Rule Updates**: Allow rules to be dynamically added or updated without restarting the WAF or the web server.
- **Future AI/LLM Integration**: Prepare the WAF for future enhancements with AI/LLM to detect and respond to more sophisticated threats.

### 2.2 WAF as a Standalone Application

#### 2.2.1 Standalone Mode
- **HTTP Traffic Monitoring**: The WAF should be able to monitor HTTP traffic independently, using a network tap or port mirroring.
- **CLI**: Develop a command-line interface for configuration, monitoring, and management of the WAF in standalone mode.
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure the WAF operates with minimal latency and resource usage in standalone mode.

### 2.3 TCP Stream Monitoring

#### 2.3.1 TCP Stream Listener
- **Raw Packet Analysis**: Implement a module to listen to TCP streams, detecting patterns indicative of ransomware or other malicious activity.
- **Background Processing**: Analyze traffic in the background, without real-time constraints, to detect potential threats.

#### 2.3.2 Ransomware Detection
- **Pattern Matching**: Develop a pattern-matching engine for identifying ransomware signatures in TCP streams.
- **AI/LLM Integration**: Integrate AI/LLM models for enhanced detection capabilities, with configurable parameters through the web interface.

### 2.4 Web Interface (UI)

#### 2.4.1 Configuration Management
- **User Interface**: Develop a web-based UI for configuring WAF settings, including:
  - Rule management (viewing, adding, editing, deleting rules).
  - Integration settings for Apache2, HAProxy, and Nginx.
  - Logging and monitoring settings.
  - AI/LLM parameters configuration (model selection, threshold settings, etc.).

#### 2.4.2 Dashboard
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provide a dashboard for real-time monitoring of WAF activity, including:
  - Number of requests processed.
  - Number of blocked or flagged requests.
  - Performance metrics.
  - Alerts and notifications.

#### 2.4.3 Logs and Reporting
- **Logs**: Develop a logs management module within the UI to view and analyze logs.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports based on detected threats, traffic patterns, and WAF performance.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- **Efficiency**: Ensure the WAF is optimized for low-latency operation, particularly in high-traffic environments.
- **Scalability**: Design the WAF to handle increased loads, both in terms of HTTP traffic and the number of rules.

### 3.2 Security
- **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's memory safety features to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- **Secure API**: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for the web interface and API.

### 3.3 Usability
- **User-Friendly UI**: Design the web interface to be intuitive, with easy navigation and clear configuration options.
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation, including a user manual, API reference, and developer guide.

### 3.4 Extensibility
- **Modular Architecture**: Develop the WAF with a modular architecture, allowing for easy addition of new features and integrations.
- **Plugin Support**: Consider supporting plugins or modules that can be added to extend WAF functionality.
